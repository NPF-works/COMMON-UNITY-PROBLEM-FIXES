ever see a console information with an error that says:
that you have unused or missing script or meta data

well that's because the Unity Dev's removed:
on script delete,call meta data cleanup

to fix that this script will resolve such a thing


please note... that this script in vrchat may cause world/avatar upload cancelation
if that is the case with your situation
then move that scrip outside of asset folder
and when upload is completed you can return that script into your project folder again


enjoy :)
